CRUD Functions: [Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete]
---------------

First : GET [Retrieve] -- It will show all your entered data in your database it will show you in the table
        -- for 'Get' you don't required 'inner body' -- which means you don't need form

Second : DELETE -- [Delete] -- It is used to 'delete' your data
        -- Based on given 'id' that 'id' data will delete
        -- for 'Delete' also you don't required 'inner body' -- which means you don't need form

Third : POST [Create] -- It will 'create' new data
        -- for 'Create' It requires inner body
        -- In 'Create' -- We are doing two process
        -- first process -- opening the form and filling the data
        -- second process -- while submitting it will saving the data

Fourth : PUT [Update] -- It will 'update' the existing data
         -- for 'Update' It requires inner body
         -- In 'Update' -- We are doing two process
         -- first process -- opening the form and filling the data
         -- second process -- while submitting it will saving the data
         -- But, the difference between 'post' is, we have to give 'instance & id' here in 'update'
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Flow -- getMethod call -- open 'table.html' -- Click 'post' -- 'postMethod' call -- [first process execute]
        -- open 'form.html' fill the data in forms -- while submitting [second process execute] -- It
        -- saving the data. In 'forms.py' we connect to the 'model.py' so these data will automatically
        -- stores in the 'table.html' -- When you give 'delete' -- that particular data 'id' passes
        -- to the 'delete function' and it 'deletes' the data. When you give 'Update' -- it will call
        -- 'updateMethod' -- [first process execute] open 'form.html' fill the data in forms --
        -- while submitting [second process execute] -- Before saving the data, we are passing the
        -- 'instance & id' if that instance and id is there, it's not created, but it will 'update' the data.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step:1

        Create one app Ex. crudApp, Inside 'crudApp' you find the 'models.py'
    --- In 'models.py' define your table headers
    --- In 'admin.py' register your 'models.py'
    --- Create one 'templates' directory -- inside create one 'table.html' file
    --- In 'table.html' you have to give your table formats like 'thead' and 'tdata'
    --- Create one 'forms.py' inside your 'crudApp'
    --- Inside 'forms.py' -- Here 'forms.py' we have to give different approach
            -- you have to say 'class Meta' -- This is organizer
            -- model = 'your models.py class name'
            -- fields = '__all__' -- This fetch all details what you given in the 'table' it will come to
                    -- your 'forms' also
    --- Then, create one 'form.html' inside your 'templates'
    --- Inside 'form.html' -- you have to give 'action & method' method = 'POST'
    --- Inside 'form.html' -- We have to use {% csrf_token %} inside your <form>


Step:2

        -- In 'views' -- import your 'models.py' & 'forms.py' & 'redirect'
        -- In views write the function for 'get'
        -- In views write the function for 'post'
                -- Part 1 - first it will open 'form.py'
                -- Part 2 - When you give 'submit' it will save that data
        -- In views write the function for 'delete'
        -- In views write the function for 'update'
                -- Part 1 - first it will open 'form.py'
                -- Part 2 - When you give 'submit' it will save that data

Step:3

          -- In 'settings.py' -- register your 'crudApp name' & 'template name'
          -- In blog 'urls.py' -- include your 'crudApp.url'
          -- In your 'crudApp' -- create 'urls.py' -- Mention your 'function names'


Step:4

          -- Now, you want to connect with Database for that you have to write the command.
          -- py manage.py makemigrations crudApp [after makemigrations give your app name]
          -- py manage.py migrate
          -- py manage.py createsuperuser
          -- Enter username
          -- Enter Mail Id
          -- Enter Password
          -- Confirm Password
          -- py manage.py runserver --- http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin -- give this and login
          -- Inside Database, Enter your data
          -- for another 'app' you want to use in same 'project' again don't use 'createsuperuser'
          -- you can directly access your database with your previous login and use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important Note:
---------------

          -- you filled the data in your 'model.py' -- when you seeing 127.00.8000/admin -- your table
          ---- is not found -- that time, you have to give this command 'py manage.py makemigrations
          ------- crudApp(your app name)'. Because it don't know the table where to add, that time
          --------- You have to tell your 'app name'

          -- When you giving this 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/crudApp/postData/crudApp/getData/' -- page not
          ------ found 404 it shows -- In redirect you have to say your 'app name' before you have to give
          --------- '/' like this --- return redirect (request,'/crudApp/getData/')

          -- But in render don't use '/' before like --'return render(request,
          ---------- 'ExampleFour/InventoryStockTable.html', {'datas': datas})'

          -- Here in 'CRUD' we are passing two parameters in 'action'. Because 'post' and 'put' doing
          ---------- the same operations. To show to the action specifically we are following this.
