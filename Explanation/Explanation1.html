Web Service:
-------------

HTTP: Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

HTTP : It is the communication between web browser (client machine) to web server (server machine)
       -- Client (web page or web browser) giving the 'HTTP Request' to the web server. Then web server
       -------- returns 'HTTP Response' to the client(web page or web browser)


HTTPS : Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure

HTTPS : It is similar to 'HTTP'.
        -- In 'HTTP' the request is in open source.But here the request in 'encrypted' mode
        -- It makes the data safe from the hackers
        -- 'HTTPS' actually we use
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API's :
        --- API = Application Programming Interface
        --- We call 'Url' as 'API'.

API's Types:

        --- SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)
        --- REST (Representational State Transfer)


SOAP:

        --- It is the older type. It have strict procedure
        --- It passing the data in the 'XML' form
        --- Syntax : Data will pass like:
        <request>
            <studentName> Rathesh </studentName>
        </request>

REST:

        --- It is new type. We are using this
        --- It passing the data in both 'XML' & 'Json' form
        --- We are passing the data in 'Json' form only
        --- Syntax : Data will pass like:
        {
            "studentName" : "Rathesh",
            "Age" : 25
        }

REST Methods:
CRUD: We are getting the 'response' in 'url' - from that we are doing these operations
        --- Create [POST]
        --- Retrieve [GET]
        --- Update [PUT]
        --- Delete [DELETE]
        --- Patch [Partial Update]   --- Only some details, we can modify -- We are not using this much
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Flow:
        User -- In Frontend, He will give the data and submit -- That data will pass as the 'request'
        ----- to the server -- If that 'request' is success, then it will fetch the data from the database
        ----- and it gives that data as 'response' to the user. If that request is failure, then it will
        ----- 'error' message as 'response' to the user.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


request :
---------

        endpoint : http://127.0.0.1:8000/registrationApp/getData5?Rathesh
        base url : http://127.0.0.1:8000
        resource : registrationApp/getData5
        parameter: Rathesh

        Parameter We have two types:
        --- path parameter -- /
        --- Query parameter -- ?(optional)
        But we are using 'path parameter' only

CSRF: Cross Site Request Forgery

CSRF: It is used to prevent web attacks from the hacker through malicious websites

      Example: You login your net banking in the trusted site. While login you are visiting the
      --- Un-authorized websites.From that Un-authorized websites it sends money transfer request through
      --------- cookies to your net banking website, without intimation money will transfer

      --- Avoiding this issue, we are using 'CSRF'. 'CSRF' will create unique values on the forms
      --------- When Un-authorized websites sends money transfer request through cookies, it will check
      ------------- whether that cookies contains these 'CSRF' generated value. If same, then only it will
      ---------------- transfer, if not, it won't execute that request.
